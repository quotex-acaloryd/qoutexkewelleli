# Quotex Martingale Strategy: A Comprehensive Guide for Indian Traders

## What is Martingale in Quotex?

The Martingale strategy is a popular trading strategy that involves
doubling your stake after every losing trade. The idea is that
eventually, you will win a trade and recover all of your previous
losses, plus make a profit. However, it\'s important to note that the
Martingale strategy is a high-risk strategy and can lead to large losses
if you are not careful.
